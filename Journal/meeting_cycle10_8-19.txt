Contact Dr. Ebaa once after Dr Jayyousi comes back from the vacation.

How does QNRF work?

Is it possible to change the protocol,

Good justification to reach to the same goal.

Achieve a more wearable system like a CGM system

Get the ground truth from the CGM system, not the 

Get the naturalistic data, ethicalogically more valid

This can be done in Desman 

Develop a sensor so that 

Challenge:

1. Make a device that lasts for one week

2. We'll be more closer to our goal if we are 

3. We'll be in a different category to obtain the IRB

5. Change request to QNRF

6. Change the protocol. This will have two parts.

WP1 : more work on the sensor development

WP2 : Change the type of subjects to healthy, 

Develop a new sensor.

Motiv  - ring sensor

Recruit people that use CGMs. Study requires the data to be shared by the user. 

We need to be more study. 

We need to replace aim 1. the validation 

We should talk about how it 

WP1 data collection 

If the system is designed well 

AIM 1: improving the form of the device. We should claim that the wp2 and wp3 adds into the design methodology

Buy motiv. Buy E4.

Design of the integrated system. Look at CGM system.

Very critical for us to find 

CGM sensors prevalent in the USA.

CGM Sensors in the USA



Action Items:
Hasan: look for the sensors above

We are meeting at the same meeting.

Consult with Hamad and Sidra what they have on CGMs

Hasan: build correlation on the devices above.

Find the justification for replacing our device with the above devices.

With the new approach, it will be easier to recruit new patients.

We can buy devices

commercial cots devices
